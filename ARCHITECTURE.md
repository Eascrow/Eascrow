# Eascrow - Technical Product

Eascrow is an innovative web3 escrow service that harnesses the power of Soroban smart contracts to streamline and secure online transactions. It acts as a trusted intermediary, ensuring that funds are safely held and released according to the terms agreed upon by the involved parties. This service is essential for various financial dealings, ranging from material goods trade to freelance services.

## I. Eascrow – $${\textsf{\color{cyan}Service Providing}}$$ Payment
### 1. **Initiation of Service**
The service process begins when the customer requests a specific service through the Eascrow platform. At this stage, the customer agrees to the terms and conditions defined by the platform. These terms ensure that both parties—the customer and the service provider—are clear on the scope of the service, the payment, and the timeframe. By agreeing to these terms, the customer initiates the secure escrow process, ensuring the funds will be held safely until the conditions are met.

---

### 2. **Escrow Setup**
Once the customer agrees to the terms, Eascrow sets up a secure escrow account on the Soroban blockchain. This blockchain-based escrow account acts as a neutral intermediary to hold the payment. The use of Soroban ensures transparency and immutability, meaning that no funds can be accessed until all conditions are met. This guarantees both parties are protected, as the transaction is securely locked into the blockchain.

---

### 3. **Payment Deposit**
The next step is for the customer to deposit the agreed-upon payment into the escrow account. This transaction is recorded on the Soroban blockchain, ensuring transparency and traceability. The funds are now securely held by the Eascrow platform until the service provider fulfills the terms of the agreement. This eliminates the risk of upfront payments being misused, creating a safe environment for both the buyer and the seller.

---

### 4. **Service Provision**
Once the payment is confirmed, the service provider is notified that the funds are securely held in the escrow account. With this assurance, the service provider can begin working on the requested service. The service provider has the security of knowing that payment is already secured and will be released upon completion of the work, reducing risks of non-payment.

---

### 5. **Confirmation of Service**
After the service provider has completed their work, the customer reviews and confirms the service provided. The customer verifies that the service meets the agreed-upon terms and confirms the delivery of the service on the Eascrow platform. This step is crucial, as it triggers the release of funds. The confirmation acts as a green light for Eascrow to finalize the transaction and release the payment to the service provider.

---

### 6. **Payment Release**
Upon receiving the customer’s confirmation of service completion, Eascrow initiates the process of releasing the payment. A request is sent to the Soroban blockchain to unlock the funds and transfer them to the service provider. This process is secure, automatic, and relies on blockchain technology to ensure transparency and prevent tampering.

---

### 7. **Transaction Completion**
The service provider confirms the receipt of payment through the Eascrow platform. Once this step is completed, the blockchain registers the successful completion of the transaction. This ensures that both parties are aware of the final outcome, and the service provider has access to the funds they have earned.

---

### 8. **Confirmation to Customer**
Finally, Eascrow notifies the customer that the transaction has been successfully completed. Both the customer and the service provider receive a confirmation from Eascrow, closing the transaction cycle. This confirmation includes details such as the release of funds and the final resolution, providing both parties with transparency and peace of mind.

> The situation below presents the dispute resolution system in a Service Providing process.

### Dispute Scenario
If the customer is dissatisfied with the service, they can raise a dispute with the Eascrow platform. Eascrow has a dedicated Dispute Resolution System that is designed to handle such situations. This process ensures that both parties are heard and that the situation is resolved fairly and transparently.

---

### Dispute Resolution Process
Once a dispute is raised, the Dispute Resolution System initiates an investigation. This involves communication with both the customer and the service provider. The system gathers all relevant information, including the service details and the issues raised by the customer. The Dispute Resolution team examines the situation in depth to ensure a fair outcome for both parties.

---

### Resolution Outcomes
Depending on the investigation, the outcome can favor either the customer or the service provider:

- **If the customer is favored:** The Dispute Resolution System will instruct Eascrow to refund the customer from the escrow account. This ensures the customer is protected if the service was not delivered as agreed.
  
- **If the service provider is favored:** The Dispute Resolution System will instruct Eascrow to release the funds to the service provider. This ensures that the provider is compensated if they have fulfilled the service according to the terms agreed upon.

---

### Notification of Resolution
Once a decision has been made, Eascrow will notify both the customer and the service provider of the outcome. This notification includes a detailed explanation of the resolution and any actions taken, such as a refund or the release of funds. Both parties can then move forward, having been informed of the final decision.

## II. Eascrow – $${\textsf{\color{lightgreen}Goods}}$$ Payment

### 1. Product Order Initiation
The buyer begins the process by placing an order through the Eascrow platform. At this stage, the buyer agrees to the terms and conditions of the transaction, which ensures that both the buyer and the seller are aligned on the expectations and conditions for the exchange of goods.

---

### 2. Escrow Account Setup
Once the order is confirmed, Eascrow creates a secure escrow account for the transaction on the Soroban blockchain. This account will hold the funds until the terms of the transaction are fulfilled, providing both parties with confidence that the payment is safely locked until the product has been delivered and verified.

---

### 3. Payment to Escrow
The buyer deposits the payment into the escrow account set up by Eascrow. This ensures that the seller can see that the payment is ready and secured, but cannot access it until the buyer confirms the receipt of the product. The use of blockchain ensures full transparency and security of the funds.

---

### 4. Seller Notification
Once the payment is secured, Eascrow informs the seller that the funds are available and the order details have been confirmed. This allows the seller to move forward with shipping the product to the buyer, knowing that the funds are locked into the escrow account and awaiting confirmation of delivery.

---

### 5. Product Shipping
The seller is now responsible for shipping the product to the buyer. Eascrow monitors the status of the transaction and ensures that both parties follow the agreed-upon terms.

---

### 6. Product Reception
Once the buyer receives the product, they must confirm the receipt through the Eascrow platform. This confirmation indicates that the product was received in acceptable condition and that the buyer is satisfied with the purchase, allowing the funds to be released.

---

### 7. Payment Transfer
After the buyer confirms the receipt of the product, Eascrow sends an instruction to the Soroban blockchain to release the funds to the seller. This automated process ensures that the seller is compensated quickly and securely, without the need for any additional steps.

---

### 8. Transaction Completion
Finally, Eascrow notifies the buyer that the transaction has been successfully completed. The seller has received their payment, and the buyer has their product, concluding the transaction with transparency and security.

> The situation below presents the dispute resolution system in a Goods Payment process.

### Dispute Scenario
If the buyer is dissatisfied with the product they received, they have the option to raise a dispute with the Eascrow platform. This initiates a formal process to address the buyer's concerns and determine the proper course of action. The dispute ensures that both the buyer and seller are protected in case of disagreements over the product's condition or delivery.

---

### Dispute Resolution Process
Once a dispute is raised, Eascrow initiates a dispute resolution process. This involves a dedicated Dispute Resolution entity that communicates with both the buyer and the seller to gather all relevant details. The process includes reviewing any documentation, communication, and evidence provided by both parties to come to an informed decision.

---

### Resolution Outcomes
The outcome of the dispute can favor either the buyer or the seller, depending on the evidence presented:

- **If resolved in favor of the buyer:** Eascrow processes a refund to the buyer, withdrawing the funds from the escrow account and returning them to the buyer. This outcome typically occurs if the product was not as described or failed to meet the agreed-upon terms.

- **If resolved in favor of the seller:** The funds are released to the seller, finalizing the transaction. This happens if the product was delivered as promised and the buyer's dissatisfaction does not align with the terms of the transaction.

---

### Notification of Resolution
After a resolution has been reached, Eascrow promptly notifies both the buyer and the seller of the decision. This notification includes the outcome of the dispute resolution, whether it be a refund to the buyer or a payment to the seller, and provides closure for the transaction.

## III. Eascrow - $${\textsf{\color{orange}Product System}}$$ Interface

### 1. Start
The process begins when the user arrives at the account creation interface on the Eascrow platform. Here, the user is introduced to the different options available for creating an account, depending on whether they intend to engage in product-related transactions or service-based transactions.

---

### 2. Account Type Selection
At this stage, the user must choose between two types of accounts:
- **Product Account:** This requires the user to provide an email address and complete a KYC (Know Your Customer) verification process.
- **Service Account:** This only requires the generation of a wallet address, making the process simpler for users who are solely focused on services.

---

### 3. Product Account
If the user selects a **Product Account**, they will need to enter their email address and complete the KYC verification process. This is necessary to comply with legal requirements and to ensure the security and legitimacy of the transactions on the platform.

---

### 4. Service Account
If the user selects a **Service Account**, a wallet address is automatically generated for them. This option is streamlined, requiring no further personal information aside from the wallet, and is designed for those engaging in service-based transactions.

---

### 5. Verification and KYC Process
For **Product Account** users, the platform will initiate a verification process. The user must verify their email address and complete the KYC verification. This involves submitting necessary identity documents and personal information to comply with legal and regulatory standards.

---

### 6. KYC Verification Success
- **If the KYC process is successful:** The account is created on the Soroban blockchain, enabling the user to engage in transactions.
- **If the KYC process fails:** The user is prompted to retry the verification process until successful.

---

### 7. Login Interface
Once the account creation is complete, the user can access the login interface. This is where they will enter their credentials (email for product accounts, wallet for service accounts) to log into their Eascrow dashboard.

---

### 8. Credential Validation
After entering their credentials, the platform validates the login details, granting the user access to their escrow dashboard. This step ensures that only verified users can access their account and conduct transactions.

---

### 9. Escrow Dashboard
Once logged in, the user arrives at the **Escrow Dashboard**. This is the central hub where they can initiate new escrow transactions, monitor ongoing transactions, or receive payments. The dashboard provides an easy-to-navigate interface for managing all escrow-related activities.
